I want to build a web app called ‘TradeRiser’ for my trade copy community, focusing on trade copying (like a simplified ZuluTrade). Signal providers share observer accounts, subscribers copy trades with custom settings, and the service is monetized with paid subscriptions (including a free trial) and provider rewards. Subscribers can have multiple trade accounts, and each trade account can copy trades from multiple signal accounts (many-to-many relationship). Here’s the detailed functionality:

User Authentication:
Sign-up/login page: email, password, username, role (signal provider or subscriber).
On sign-up, users provide a display name/nickname (e.g., ‘TraderJoe’).
After login, users go to their dashboard.
Signal Provider Dashboard:
Form to add observer accounts: ‘Account Nickname’ (e.g., ‘Aggressive Scalper’), ‘Description’ (e.g., ‘High-risk, short-term trades on EUR/USD’), ‘Account ID,’ ‘Broker Name,’ ‘API Key/Token’.
List all their signal accounts with performance stats: return %, win rate, total trades, profit/loss, max drawdown %.
For each signal account:
Show open trades (e.g., ‘Buy EUR/USD at 1.1000, SL 1.0950, TP 1.1100, Status: Open’).
Show trade history (e.g., ‘Sell GBP/USD at 1.3000, Closed, Profit: +30 pips’).
Show earnings: ‘Total Earnings: $X’ (calculated as: $10 per subscriber per month + $50 bonus per 10% return).
Subscriber Dashboard:
Form to add multiple trade accounts: ‘Broker Name,’ ‘Account ID,’ ‘API Key/Token’ (e.g., ‘IC Markets, ID: 12345’ and ‘Pepperstone, ID: 67890’).
List all trade accounts and their subscriptions:
Example: ‘IC Markets Account: Copying Aggressive Scalper (Trial: Ends 2025-04-02), Steady Growth (Active)’ and ‘Pepperstone Account: Copying Trend Follower (Trial)’).
For each trade account:
Show open trades per signal account (e.g., ‘IC Markets – Aggressive Scalper: Buy EUR/USD at 1.1000, Lot Size: 0.5x’).
Show trade history per signal account (e.g., ‘IC Markets – Aggressive Scalper: Sell GBP/USD, Profit: +15 pips’).
Button to ‘Manage Subscriptions’ (links to Providers page).
Main Page (Home):
Top Performers: List top-performing signal accounts (sorted by return %): show provider’s name/nickname, signal account nickname, return %, win rate, max drawdown % (e.g., ‘Provider: TraderJoe – Aggressive Scalper, Return: +150%’).
‘View Details’ button: opens a modal with a graph of return % over time (line chart, last 6 months).
General Comments Section: A section for community comments (e.g., ‘Great platform!’), with a form to post comments and display existing ones (username, timestamp).
‘View Provider’ button: links to the provider’s profile page.
Providers Page:
List all signal accounts: provider’s name/nickname, signal account nickname, description, stats (return %, win rate, drawdown).
‘View Profile’ button: links to the provider’s profile page.
‘Subscribe’ button:
If no trade accounts are added, prompt: ‘Please add a trade account in the dashboard first.’
If trade accounts exist, show a dropdown: ‘Select Trade Account to Copy To’ (e.g., ‘IC Markets,’ ‘Pepperstone’).
Start a 7-day free trial for the subscription (no payment required).
After trial, charge $30/month via Stripe (unless canceled).
Allow setting copy preferences: lot size (0.5x/1x/2x), reverse copy, filters (‘Only SL/TP trades’).
Save subscription, trial status, and settings to the database, linked to the selected trade account.
Provider Profile Page:
Show provider’s name/nickname, list of their signal accounts with stats and descriptions.
Comments section: users can post comments about the provider (e.g., ‘Great signals!’), show comments with username and timestamp.
‘Subscribe’ button for each signal account (same flow as Providers page).
Trade Copying:
Backend pulls trades from signal accounts (mock with sample data: ‘Buy EUR/USD at 1.1000, SL 1.0950, TP 1.1100’).
Broadcast trades to subscribers in real-time, copy to their selected trade account(s) based on settings.
Store trades in the database (open trades, history).
Payment, Free Trial, and Rewards:
Free trial: 7 days for new subscriptions, track trial status (start date, active/expired).
After trial, charge $30/month via Stripe (notify: ‘Trial ends on [date]. Subscribe to continue.’).
Track subscription status in the database.
Provider rewards: $10 per subscriber per month + $50 bonus per 10% return.
Store and display provider earnings in their dashboard.
Database (Supabase):
Store users: email, password (hashed), username, display name/nickname, role.
Store signal accounts: nickname, description, Account ID, Broker, API Key/Token, stats.
Store subscriber trade accounts: Broker, Account ID, API Key/Token (multiple per subscriber).
Store M-to-M relationships (trade account to signal account): trade account ID, signal account ID, copy settings, trial status, payment status.
Store trades: open trades, trade history (linked to trade account and signal account).
Store comments: user, signal account or general, comment text, timestamp.
Store provider earnings.
Design:
Dark theme (black background, white text, green/red for buy/sell).
Mobile-friendly, responsive.
Navigation: Home, Providers, Subscriptions, Profile, Logout.
Technical Requirements:
React and TypeScript for the frontend.
Node.js backend for trade broadcasting, copying, and payment processing.
Supabase for database and real-time updates (trades, comments).
Use Chart.js for performance graphs.
Integrate Stripe for payments.
